    \caption{Correlation between EPSPS-inhibitor resistant \textit{Amaranthus palmeri} individuals with phenotypic (glyphosate) and genotypic (\textit{EPSPS} gene amplification) resistance assays. Dots are color coded to indicate resistance to PPO inhibitors, based on genotypic assays ($\triangle$G210 mutation).}

    \caption{Random forest analysis of likelihood of EPSPS-inhibitor resistance (genotypic assay) in \textit{Amaranthus palmeri} populations in response to mechanism of resistance, agronomic practices, and geographic location and weed demographics in southwestern Nebraska. Variables are ordered by importance measured using the Gini coefficient.}

    \caption{Percentage of diversty in current and previous crop where the EPSPS-(A) and PPO-(B) resistant \textit{Amaranthus palmeri} populations was found in southwestern Nebraska. Based on genotypic resistance assay, populations are grouped into EPSPS- or PPO-Resistant, EPSPS- or PPO-Segregating and EPSPS- or PPO-Susceptible representing \textit{A. palmeri} with all resistant, partially resistant, and no resistant individuals, respectively. Other crops are represented by snap beans}
