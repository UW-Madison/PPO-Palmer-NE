However, herbicide-resistant (HR) weed populations are evolving rapidly as a natural response to selection pressure imposed by modern agricultural management activities. Mitigating the evolution of herbicide resistance depends on reducing selection through diversification of weed control techniques, minimizing the spread of resistance genes and genotypes via pollen or propagule dispersal, and eliminating additions of weed seed to the soil seedbank. Effective deployment of such a multifaceted approach will require shifting from the current concept of basing weed management on single-year economic thresholds.},

The overall objective of this work was to review the utilization of RF classifier in remote sensing. This review has revealed that RF classifier can successfully handle high data dimensionality and multicolinearity, being both fast and insensitive to overfitting. It is, however, sensitive to the sampling design. The variable importance (VI) measurement provided by the RF classifier has been extensively exploited in different scenarios, for example to reduce the number of dimensions of hyperspectral data, to identify the most relevant multisource remote sensing and geographic data, and to select the most suitable season to classify particular target classes. Further investigations are required into less commonly exploited uses of this classifier, such as for sample proximity analysis to detect and remove outliers in the training samples.},

  abstract = {Molecular assays are often implemented by weed scientists for detection of herbicide-resistant individuals; however, the utility of these assays can be limited if multiple mechanisms of evolved resistance exist. Waterhemp resistant to protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO)– inhibiting herbicides is conferred by a target-site mutation in PPX2L (a gene coding for PPO), resulting in the loss of a glycine at position 210 (ΔG210). This ΔG210 mutation of PPX2L is the only known mechanism responsible for PPO-inhibitor resistance (PPO-R) in waterhemp from five states (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri); however, a limited number of populations have been tested, especially in Illinois. To verify the ubiquity of the ΔG210 in PPO-R waterhemp populations in Illinois, a previously published allele-specific PCR (asPCR) was used for the detection of the ΔG210 mutation to associate this mutation with phenotypic resistance in 94 Illinois waterhemp populations. The ΔG210 mutation was detected in all populations displaying phenotypic resistance to lactofen (220 g ai ha−1), indicating the deletion is likely the only mechanism of resistance. With evidence that the ΔG210 mutation dominates PPO-R waterhemp biotypes, molecular detection techniques have considerable utility. Unfortunately, the previously published asPCR is time consuming, very sensitive to PCR conditions, and requires additional steps to eliminate the possibility of false negatives. To overcome these limitations, a streamlined molecular method using the TaqMan® technique was developed, utilizing allele-specific, fluorescent probes for high-throughput, robust discrimination of each allele (resistant and susceptible) at the 210th amino acid position of PPX2L.Nomenclature: Lactofen; waterhemp, Amaranthus tuberculatus (Moq.)

A late-season weed-escape survey was conducted in the major row crop–producing counties (29 counties) to determine the severity of PPO-inhibitor resistance in Arkansas. A total of 227 Palmer amaranth accessions were sprayed with fomesafen at 395 g ha−1 to identify putative resistant plants. A TaqMan qPCR assay was used to confirm the presence of the ΔG210 codon deletion or the R128G/M (homologous to R98 mutation in common ragweed) target-site resistance mechanisms in the PPX2 gene. Out of the 227 accessions screened, 44 were completely controlled with fomesafen, and 16 had only one or two severely injured plants (≥98\% mortality) when compared with the 1986 susceptible check (100\% mortality). The remaining 167 accessions were genotypically screened, and 82 (49\%) accessions were found to harbor the ΔG210 deletion in the PPX2 gene. The R128G was observed in 47 (28\%) out of the 167 accessions screened. The mutation R128M, on the other hand was rare, found in only three accessions. About 13\% of the accessions were segregating for both the ΔG210 and R128G mutations. Sixteen percent of the tested accessions had mortality ratings {$<$}90\% and did not test positive for the ΔG210 or the R128G/M resistance mechanisms, indicating that a novel target or non–target site resistance mechanism is likely. Overall, PPO inhibitor–resistant Palmer amaranth is widespread in Arkansas, and the ΔG210 resistance mechanism is especially dominant in the northeast corridor, while the R128G mutation is more prevalent in counties near Memphis, TN.},

  abstract = {Waterhemp is an increasingly problematic weed in the U.S. Midwest, having now evolved resistances to herbicides from six different site-of-action groups. Glyphosate-resistant waterhemp in the Midwest is especially concerning given the economic importance of glyphosate in corn and soybean production. Amplification of the target-site gene, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) was found to be the mechanism of glyphosate resistance in Palmer amaranth, a species closely related to waterhemp. Here, the relationship between glyphosate resistance and EPSPS gene amplification in waterhemp was investigated. Glyphosate dose response studies were performed at field sites with glyphosate-resistant waterhemp in Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and Nebraska, and relative EPSPS copy number of survivors was determined via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Waterhemp control increased with increasing glyphosate rate at all locations, but no population was completely controlled even at the highest rate (3,360 g ae ha−1). EPSPS gene amplification was present in plants from four of five locations (Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska) and the proportion of plants with elevated copy number was generally higher in survivors from glyphosate-treated plots than in plants from the untreated control plots. Copy number magnitude varied by site, but an overall trend of increasing copy number with increasing rate was observed in populations with gene amplification, suggesting that waterhemp plants with more EPSPS copies are more resistant. Survivors from the Kentucky population did not have elevated EPSPS copy number. Instead, resistance in this population was attributed to the EPSPS Pro106Ser mutation. Results herein show a quantitative relationship between glyphosate resistance and EPSPS gene amplification in some waterhemp populations, while highlighting that other mechanisms also confer glyphosate resistance in waterhemp.},

Within this population, glyphosate resistance correlates with increases in (a) genomic copy number of EPSPS, (b) expression of the EPSPS transcript, (c) EPSPS protein level, and (d) EPSPS enzymatic activity. Dose response results from the resistant and an F2 population suggest that between 30 and 50 EPSPS genomic copies are necessary to survive glyphosate rates between 0.5 and 1.0 kg ha−1. These results further confirm the role of EPSPS gene amplification in conferring glyphosate resistance in this population of Palmer amaranth.

  abstract = {Herbicide-resistant Palmer amaranth has become the most economically detrimental weed of cotton in the southeast United States. With the continual marginalization of potential herbicide tools, research has expanded to include alternative means of affecting future Palmer amaranth populations by altering safe sites and reducing inputs to the seedbank population. The influence of delayed Palmer amaranth establishment on seed production potential has not been investigated in the southeast United States. Studies were conducted to evaluate the influence of time of Palmer amaranth establishment on morphology, growth, and seed production. The experiment was a factorial, with five levels of Palmer amaranth transplanting (0 to 12 wk after cotton planting) and two levels of crop type (cotton and noncrop). In the absence of crop competition, the first cohort of Palmer amaranth produced 446,000 seeds per plant. This potential seed production was reduced 50\% when Palmer amaranth plants were established nearly 6 wk later. In contrast, the first Palmer amaranth cohort growing in competition with cotton produced 312,000 seeds, 30\% less than was produced in the absence of competition. Interference from cotton shifted time to 50\% seed production to nearly 4 wk earlier in the growing season, relative to plants without crop competition. Delayed establishment of Palmer amaranth simulates premature loss of herbicide efficacy and alters the competitive balance between cotton and Palmer amaranth. Although the planting time that resulted in 50\% reduction in Palmer amaranth plant height at the end of the season was not affected by the presence of cotton, 50\% reduction in plant width and biomass occurred within the first 3.8 wk of the growing season when growing with cotton, more than 4 wk earlier than Palmer amaranth growing without a crop. This suggests that early season weed control programs will have a large effect on Palmer amaranth potential growth and seed production, as well as crop yield. To implement soil seedbank reduction strategies effectively, information on mechanisms that regulate Palmer amaranth persistence in the soil seedbank is needed.},

Do EPSPS target-site glyphosate resistance mutations lead to impaired EPSPS activity? VII. Does glyphosate resistance by EPSPS gene amplification and overexpression correlate with a fitness cost due to energy constraints? VIII. Evolutionary rescue of fitness costs IX. Final remarks Acknowledgements References Summary We reviewed the literature to understand the effects of glyphosate resistance on plant fitness at the molecular, biochemical and physiological levels. A number of correlations between enzyme characteristics and glyphosate resistance imply the existence of a plant fitness cost associated with resistance-conferring mutations in the glyphosate target enzyme, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). These biochemical changes result in a tradeoff between the glyphosate resistance of the EPSPS enzyme and its catalytic activity. Mutations that endow the highest resistance are more likely to decrease catalytic activity by reducing the affinity of EPSPS for its natural substrate, and/or slowing the velocity of the enzyme reaction, and are thus very likely to endow a substantial plant fitness cost. Prediction of fitness costs associated with EPSPS gene amplification and overexpression can be more problematic. The validity of cost prediction based on the theory of evolution of gene expression and resource allocation has been cast into doubt by contradictory experimental evidence. Further research providing insights into the role of the EPSPS cassette in weed adaptation, and estimations of the energy budget involved in EPSPS amplification and overexpression are required to understand and predict the biochemical and physiological bases of the fitness cost of glyphosate resistance.},

For this latter mechanism, two distinct molecular genetic mechanisms have been observed, a tandem duplication mechanism and a large extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) that is tethered to the chromosomes and passed to gametes at meiosis.

  abstract = {[The ten dioecious species of Amaranthus, all originally pioneer plants of naturally disturbed habitats, have behaved quite differently during increasing human disturbance of their native continent, North America. Those at home in coastal marshes, beaches, and dunes have remained static while those from river floodplains and desert washes have been expanding and diversifying as weeds in artificially opened habitats. Direct historical evidence, mainly from a hundred year record of herbarium collections, permits partial reconstruction of the geographic and genetic changes. The amount of geographic advance has been very unequal even along different borders of a single species. In some cases expansion was local and completed before the present century; elsewhere migration has extended across whole states and is still active. However, unlike the common weedy monoecious amaranths, even the weediest dioecious species have remained geographically cohesive. With geographic expansion, former limited overlap between species has greatly deepened and exceptional hybridization has become common. Apparent hybrids derive from a large number of species pairs, involving not only all the dioecious but also some monoecious species. Crosses between dioecious and monoecious species run into a blind alley of sterility but crosses among dioecious species have yielded fertile off-spring, in some cases so abundantly that the taxonomic distinctness of the parent species is threatened. Hybrid populations are almost invariably concentrated in the newer, artificial habitats, perhaps because of less rigorous selection in such places. In natural habitats the older types of populations have remained relatively immune to invasion and hybridization.]},

  abstract = {A previously unknown glyphosate resistance mechanism, amplification of the 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthase gene, was recently reported in Amaranthus palmeri. This evolved mechanism could introgress to other weedy Amaranthus species through interspecific hybridization, representing an avenue for acquisition of a novel adaptive trait. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential for this glyphosate resistance trait to transfer via pollen from A. palmeri to five other weedy Amaranthus species (Amaranthus hybridus, Amaranthus powellii, Amaranthus retroflexus, Amaranthus spinosus, and Amaranthus tuberculatus). Field and greenhouse crosses were conducted using glyphosate-resistant male A. palmeri as pollen donors and the other Amaranthus species as pollen recipients. Hybridization between A. palmeri and A. spinosus occurred with frequencies in the field studies ranging from {$<$}0.01\% to 0.4\%, and 1.4\% in greenhouse crosses. A majority of the A. spinosus × A. palmeri hybrids grown to flowering were monoecious and produced viable seed. Hybridization occurred in the field study between A. palmeri and A. tuberculatus ({$<$}0.2\%), and between A. palmeri and A. hybridus ({$<$}0.01\%). This is the first documentation of hybridization between A. palmeri and both A. spinosus and A. hybridus.},

  abstract = {Conservation tillage reduces the physical movement of soil to the minimum required for crop establishment and production. When consistently practiced as a soil and crop management system, it greatly reduces soil erosion and is recognized for the potential to improve soil quality and water conservation and plant available water. Adoption of conservation tillage increased dramatically with the advent of transgenic, glyphosate-resistant crops that permitted in-season, over-the-top use of glyphosate (N-[phosphonomethyl] glycine), a broad-spectrum herbicide with very low mammalian toxicity and minimal potential for off-site movement in soil or water. Glyphosate-resistant crops are currently grown on approximately 70 million ha (173 million ac) worldwide. The United States has the most hectares (45 million ha [99 million ac]) of transgenic, glyphosate-resistant cultivars and the greatest number of hectares (46 million ha [114 million ac]) in conservation tillage. The practice of conservation tillage is now threatened by the emergence and rapid spread of glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri [S.] Wats.), one of several amaranths commonly called pigweeds. First identified in Georgia, it now has been reported in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Another closely related dioecious amaranth, or pigweed, common waterhemp (Amaranthus rudis Sauer), has also developed resistance to glyphosate in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Missouri. Hundreds of thousands of conservation tillage hectares, some currently under USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service conservation program contracts, are at risk of being converted to higher-intensity tillage systems due to the inability to control these glyphosate-resistant Amaranthus species in conservation tillage systems using traditional technologies. The decline of conservation tillage is inevitable without the development and rapid adoption of integrated, effective weed control strategies. Traditional and alternative weed control strategies, such as the utilization of crop and herbicide rotation and integration of high residue cereal cover crops, are necessary in order to sustain conservation tillage practices.},

Palmer amaranth at densities of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 plants m−1 was established at corn planting in 1996 and 1997 and at two locations in 1998. Soil water was monitored 240 cm deep in 30-cm increments with a neutron probe each year and at each location every 10 d. Photosynthetic photon flux was measured in 1997 and 1998 by using a circular and a linear quantum sensor for above canopy and in four 50-cm increments for within canopy, respectively. Palmer amaranth reduced corn yield from 11 to 91\% as density increased from 0.5 to 8 plants m−1. Water use efficiency of corn declined with increased Palmer amaranth density. Regardless of Palmer amaranth density, soil water extraction was greatest in the top 30 cm of the soil profile. The pattern of corn leaf area distribution was similar across Palmer amaranth densities, with 15, 70 to 75, and 5 to 15\% of the total leaf area occurring 1.5 m, 0.5 to 1.5 m, and 0 to 0.5 m above the ground, respectively. In weed-free corn, over 60\% of light was intercepted from 0.5 to 1.5 m above the ground. In contrast, in mixed canopies 60 to 80\% of light was intercepted 1 m above the ground, where 80\% of Palmer amaranth leaf area was concentrated. Under the conditions of this study, water was not a limiting factor. The effect of Palmer amaranth density on total light interception was not significant. However, within each treatment, light interception at different heights differed, emphasizing the importance of evaluating the vertical distribution of light through the canopy to assess the effect of weed height on light competition.},

  abstract = {Herbicide-resistant Palmer amaranth is a widespread issue in row-crop production in the Midsouthern US. Palmer amaranth is commonly found on roadside habitats in this region, but little is known on the degree of herbicide resistance in these populations. Herbicide resistance in roadside Palmer amaranth populations can represent the spread of an adaptive trait across a selective landscape. A large-scale survey was carried out in the Mississippi Delta region of eastern Arkansas to document the level of resistance in roadside Palmer amaranth populations to pyrithiobac and glyphosate, two important herbicides with broad history of use in the region. A total of 215 Palmer amaranth populations collected across 500 random survey sites were used in the evaluations. About 89 and 73\% of the surveyed populations showed {$>$}90\% survival to pyrithiobac and glyphosate, respectively. Further, only 3\% of the populations were completely susceptible to glyphosate, while none of the populations was completely controlled by pyrithiobac. Among the 215 populations evaluated, 209 populations showed multiple resistance to both pyrithiobac and glyphosate at varying degrees. Dose-response assays confirmed the presence of high levels of herbicide resistance in the five selected populations (≥ 25-fold compared to a susceptible standard). Results demonstrate the prevalence of multiple-herbicide resistance in roadside Palmer amaranth populations in this region. Growers should be vigilant of Palmer amaranth infestation in roadsides adjacent to their fields and implement appropriate control measures to prevent likely spread of herbicide resistance into their fields.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats is among the most problematic annual broadleaf weed species in the USA, including in Kansas. In late summer 2015, seeds of an A. palmeri population (MHR) that had survived field-use rates of 2,4-D were collected from Barton County, KS, USA. The main objectives were to: (i) confirm and characterize 2,4-D resistance in a MHR population; (ii) characterize the resistance profile of the MHR population in relation to a multiple herbicide-susceptible (MHS) population to glyphosate, chlorsulfuron, atrazine, mesotrione, fomesafen; and (iii) determine the effectiveness of alternative POST burndown herbicides for controlling MHR population. RESULTS The MHR population had 3.2-fold resistance to 2,4-D. In addition, the MHR population also exhibited multiple resistance to glyphosate (11.8-fold), chlorsulfuron (5.0-fold), atrazine (14.4-fold), and mesotrione (13.4-fold). Furthermore, the MHR population also showed reduced sensitivity to fomesafen (2.3-fold). In a separate study, dicamba with glyphosate, atrazine or fluroxypyr + 2,4-D, and paraquat alone or with atrazine, metribuzin, saflufenacil or 2,4-D provided ≥ 99\% injury to the MHR population. Similarly, saflufenacil alone or with atrazine, metribuzin or 2,4-D, and glufosinate alone or with glyphosate + 2,4-D, and glyphosate + dicamba, and a premix of bicyclopyrone + atrazine + mesotrione + S-metolachlor also effectively controlled the MHR population. CONCLUSION This research confirms the first global case of an A. palmeri population from Kansas with multiple resistance to 2,4-D, glyphosate, chlorsulfuron, atrazine and mesotrione, and reduced sensitivity to fomesafen. Dicamba, glufosinate, paraquat, and saflufenacil alone or in tank-mixtures with PRE herbicides effectively controlled this MHR population. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {Herbicide resistance may evolve at a rapid rate with the lack of proper adoption of best management practices (BMPs). This wide-spread resistance problem is particularly impactful for fields with problematic weeds such as Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri). Protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO)-inhibiting herbicides have been one of the remaining effective sites of action (SOAs) for the control of Palmer amaranth, but even these herbicides have begun to fail in many soybean fields across Arkansas, USA. The objective of this research was to determine which of the most commonly used PPO-inhibiting herbicides have the greatest effect on two putative PPO-resistant Palmer amaranth populations, compared to a susceptible standard, when applied preemergence (PRE) and postemergence (POST); as well as to test for multiple resistance to other commonly used herbicides. A dose-response study was conducted under greenhouse conditions that examined five PRE herbicides and four POST herbicides on one PPO-susceptible and two PPO-resistant populations. Complete control was not achieved at the 8X rate with any PPO-inhibiting herbicide at the PRE application; whereas for the POST application, complete control was not achieved until after the 32X rate for all herbicides. Furthermore, twenty-one different herbicides, representing various SOAs, were used to test various application timings (preplant incorporated (PPI), PRE and POST) on these populations at a 1X field rate. Both of the PPI herbicides (trifluralin and pendimethalin) provided 9.7\% mortality of Palmer amaranth. Only two PRE herbicides (in 2 SOAs) showed greater than 85\% mortality and three POST application herbicides (3 SOAs) all had greater than 95\% mortality of both Palmer amaranth populations. Thus, it is likely that PPO-inhibiting herbicides or the other commonly used herbicides, which were tested, cannot be solely relied upon in the field. Thus, the use of multiple effective sites of action along with other integrated weed management tactics need to be a focus for management of this species.},

  abstract = {Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) is a major weed in U.S. cotton and soybean production systems. Originally native to the Southwest, the species has spread throughout the country. In 2004 a population of A. palmeri was identified with resistance to glyphosate, a herbicide heavily relied on in modern no-tillage and transgenic glyphosate-resistant crop systems. This project aims to determine the degree of genetic relatedness among eight different populations of glyphosate-resistant (GR) and –susceptible (GS) A. palmeri from various geographic regions in USA by analyzing patterns of phylogeography and diversity to ascertain whether resistance evolved independently or spread from outside to an Arizona locality (AZ-R). Shikimic acid accumulation and EPSPS genomic copy assays confirmed resistance or susceptibility. With a set of 1,351 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), discovered by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), UPGMA phylogenetic analysis, principal component analysis, Bayesian model-based clustering, and pairwise comparisons of genetic distances were conducted. A GR population from Tennessee and two GS populations from Georgia and Arizona were identified as genetically distinct while the remaining GS populations from Kansas, Arizona, and Nebraska clustered together with two GR populations from Arizona and Georgia. Within the latter group, AZ-R was most closely related to the GS populations from Kansas and Arizona followed by the GR population from Georgia. GR populations from Georgia and Tennessee were genetically distinct from each other. No isolation by distance was detected and A. palmeri was revealed to be a species with high genetic diversity. The data suggest the following two possible scenarios: either glyphosate resistance was introduced to the Arizona locality from the east, or resistance evolved independently in Arizona. Glyphosate resistance in the Georgia and Tennessee localities most likely evolved separately. Thus, modern farmers need to continue to diversify weed management practices and prevent seed dispersal to mitigate herbicide resistance evolution in A. palmeri.},

The two objectives for this project were to determine what weed species are being consumed by ducks and snow geese, and to determine the recovery rate and viability of 13 agronomic weed species after passage through a duck's digestive system. RESULTS Seed recovered from digestive tracts of 526 ducks and geese harvested during a 2-year field study had 35 020 plants emerge. A greater variety of plant species emerged from ducks each year (47 and 31 species) compared to geese (11 and 3 species). Viable seed from 11 of 13 weed species fed to ducks in a controlled feeding study were recovered. Viability rate and gut retention times indicated potential dispersal up to 2900 km from the source depending on seed characteristics and variability in waterfowl dispersal distances. CONCLUSIONS Study results confirm that waterfowl are consuming seeds from a variety of agronomically important weed species, including Palmer amaranth, which can remain viable after passage through digestive tracts and have potential to be dispersed over long distances by waterfowl. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {This research was aimed at understanding how far and how fast glyphosate-resistant (GR) Palmer amaranth will spread in cotton and the consequences associated with allowing a single plant to escape control. Specifically, research was conducted to determine the collective impact of seed dispersal agents on the in-field expansion of GR Palmer amaranth, and any resulting yield reductions in an enhanced GR cotton system where glyphosate was solely used for weed control. Introduction of 20,000 GR Palmer amaranth seed into a 1-m2 circle in February 2008 was used to represent survival through maturity of a single GR female Palmer amaranth escape from the 2007 growing season. The experiment was conducted in four different cotton fields (0.53 to 0.77 ha in size) with no history of Palmer amaranth infestation. In the subsequent year, Palmer amaranth was located as far as 114 m downslope, creating a separate patch. It is believed that rainwater dispersed the seeds from the original area of introduction. In less than 2 yr after introduction, GR Palmer amaranth expanded to the boundaries of all fields, infesting over 20\% of the total field area. Spatial regression estimates indicated that no yield penalty was associated with Palmer amaranth density the first year after introduction, which is not surprising since only 0.56\% of the field area was infested with GR Palmer amaranth in 2008. Lint yield reductions as high as 17 kg ha−1 were observed 2 yr after the introduction (in 2009). Three years after the introduction (2010), Palmer amaranth infested 95 to 100\% of the area in all fields, resulting in complete crop loss since it was impossible to harvest the crop. These results indicate that resistance management options such as a “zero-tolerance threshold” should be used in managing or mitigating the spread of GR Palmer amaranth. This research demonstrates the need for proactive resistance management.},

Here, we evaluate the effects of EPSPS gene amplification on both the level of glyphosate resistance and fitness cost of resistance. A. palmeri individuals resistant to glyphosate by expressing a wide range of EPSPS gene copy numbers were evaluated under competitive conditions in the presence or absence of glyphosate. Survival rates to glyphosate and fitness traits of plants under intra-specific competition were assessed. Plants with higher amplification of the EPSPS gene (53-fold) showed high levels of glyphosate resistance, whereas less amplification of the EPSPS gene (21-fold) endowed a lower level of glyphosate resistance. Without glyphosate but under competitive conditions, plants exhibiting up to 76-fold EPSPS gene amplification exhibited similar height, and biomass allocation to vegetative and reproductive organs, compared to glyphosate susceptible A. palmeri plants with no amplification of the EPSPS gene. Both the additive effects of EPSPS gene amplification on the level of glyphosate resistance and the lack of associated fitness costs are key factors contributing to EPSPS gene amplification as a widespread and important glyphosate resistance mechanism likely to become much more evident in weed plant species.},

Thus far, single-codon non-synonymous mutations of EPSPS (5-enolypyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) have been rare and, relative to other herbicide mode of action target-site mutations, unconventionally weak in magnitude for resistance to glyphosate. However, it is possible that weeds will emerge with non-synonymous mutations of two codons of EPSPS to produce an enzyme endowing greater resistance to glyphosate. Today, target-gene duplication is a common glyphosate resistance mechanism and could become a fundamental process for developing any resistance trait. Based on competition and substrate selectivity studies in several species, rapid vacuole sequestration of glyphosate occurs via a transporter mechanism. Conversely, as the chloroplast requires transporters for uptake of important metabolites, transporters associated with the two plastid membranes may separately, or together, successfully block glyphosate delivery. A model based on finite glyphosate dose and limiting time required for chloroplast loading sets the stage for understanding how uniquely different mechanisms can contribute to overall glyphosate resistance. © 2014 The Authors.

  abstract = {Since its discovery in 2005, glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth has become a major problem for many farmers in the southern United States. One mechanism of resistance found in a Georgia population of glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth is amplification of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene throughout the genome, with some resistant plants containing and expressing more than 100 EPSPS genes. Such high numbers of EPSPS genes and protein production could result in a fitness cost to resistant plants due to (1) metabolic cost of overproduction of this enzyme and (2) disruption of other genes after insertion of the EPSPS gene. A greenhouse experiment was set up to investigate differences in growth and reproduction between glyphosate-susceptible and -resistant Palmer amaranth plants. Measurements included growth rate, plant height/volume ratio, final biomass, photosynthetic rate, inflorescence length, pollen viability, and seed set. This study found no significant fitness costs for plants with the resistance trait. This study also provided a clear example of how controlling for genetic background is important in fitness cost studies and how potentially misleading results can be obtained if only a few fitness traits are measured. These results indicate that glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth plants with high EPSPS gene copy numbers are likely to persist in field populations, even in the absence of glyphosate, potentially leading to long-term loss of glyphosate as a control option for Palmer amaranth.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Resistance to herbicides that inhibit protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) is a widespread and growing problem for weed managers across the midwestern and midsouthern United States. In Amaranthus spp., this resistance is known to be conferred by a glycine deletion at the 210th amino acid (ΔG210) in PPO2. Preliminary analysis indicated that the ΔG210 mutation did not fully account for observed resistance to PPO inhibitors in two Amaranthus palmeri populations from Tennessee and one from Arkansas. RESULTS Sequencing PPX2 cDNA from six resistant plants uncovered two new mutations at the R98 site (R98G and R98M), a site previously found to endow PPO-inhibitor resistance in Ambrosia artemisiifolia. Sequencing of this region from additional plants sprayed with 264 g fomesafen ha−1 showed the presence of one or both R98 mutations in a subset of the resistant plants from all three populations. No plants sensitive to fomesafen contained either mutation. A derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) assay to test for the presence of these mutations in A. palmeri was developed. CONCLUSION Two new mutations of PPX2 (R98G, R98M) likely confer resistance to PPO-inhibitors in A. palmeri, and can be rapidly identified using a dCAPS assay. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

Selected fomesafen-resistant accessions were sprayed with other foliar-applied PPO herbicides. Mortality and injury were evaluated 21 d after treatment (DAT). The PPX2L gene of resistant and susceptible plants from a selected accession was sequenced.

With small seedlings, cross-resistance occurred with all foliar-applied PPO herbicides except saflufenacil (i.e., 25\% with acifluorfen, 42\% with flumioxazin). Thirty-two percent of PPO-resistant accessions were multiple resistant to glyphosate and trifloxysulfuron. Resistance to PPO herbicides in Palmer amaranth occurred in at least 13 counties in Arkansas.

The PPO gene (PPX2L) in one accession (15CRI-B), which did not encode the Gly-210 deletion, encoded an Arg-128-Gly substitution. The 50\% growth reduction values for fomesafen in accessions with Gly-210 deletion were 8- to 15-fold higher than that of a susceptible population, and 3- to 10-fold higher in accessions without the Gly-210 deletion.},

Studies were conducted to confirm resistance to fomesafen (a PPO inhibitor), determine the resistance frequency, examine the resistance profile to other foliar-applied herbicides and investigate the resistance mechanism of resistant plants in a population collected in 2011 (AR11-LAW B) and its progenies from two cycles of fomesafen selection (C1 and C2). RESULTS The frequency of fomesafen-resistant plants increased from 5\% in the original AR11-LAW-B to 17\% in the C2 population. The amounts of fomesafen that caused 50\% growth reduction were 6-, 13- and 21-fold greater in AR11-LAW-B, C1 and C2 populations, respectively, than in the sensitive ecotype. The AR11-LAW-B population was sensitive to atrazine, dicamba, glufosinate, glyphosate and mesotrione but resistant to ALS-inhibiting herbicides pyrithiobac and trifloxysulfuron. Fomesafen survivors from C1 and C2 populations tested positive for the PPO glycine 210 deletion previously reported in waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus).

  abstract = {Glyphosate is the world's most important herbicide, with many uses that deliver effective and sustained control of a wide spectrum of unwanted (weedy) plant species. Until recently there were relatively few reports of weedy plant species evolving resistance to glyphosate. Since 1996, the advent and subsequent high adoption of transgenic glyphosate-resistant crops in the Americas has meant unprecedented and often exclusive use of glyphosate for weed control over very large areas. Consequently, in regions of the USA where transgenic glyphosate-resistant crops dominate, there are now evolved glyphosate-resistant populations of the economically damaging weed species Ambrosia artemissifolia L., Ambrosia trifida L., Amaranthus palmeri S Watson, Amaranthus rudis JD Sauer, Amaranthus tuberculatus (Moq) JD Sauer and various Conyza and Lolium spp. Likewise, in areas of transgenic glyphosate-resistant crops in Argentina and Brazil, there are now evolved glyphosate-resistant populations of Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers and Euphorbia heterophylla L. respectively. As transgenic glyphosate-resistant crops will remain very popular with producers, it is anticipated that glyphosate-resistant biotypes of other prominent weed species will evolve over the next few years. Therefore, evolved glyphosate-resistant weeds are a major risk for the continued success of glyphosate and transgenic glyphosate-resistant crops. However, glyphosate-resistant weeds are not yet a problem in many parts of the world, and lessons can be learnt and actions taken to achieve glyphosate sustainability. A major lesson is that maintenance of diversity in weed management systems is crucial for glyphosate to be sustainable. Glyphosate is essential for present and future world food production, and action to secure its sustainability for future generations is a global imperative.

Wats.), common waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus var. rudis), and redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) are major weeds occurring in fields throughout Nebraska with recurrent grower complaints regarding control with glyphosate. The objective of this study was to investigate the frequency and distribution of glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth, common waterhemp, and redroot pigweed populations in Nebraska. The study also aimed to investigate how agronomic practices influence the occurrence of glyphosate resistance in the three Amaranthus species. RESULTS Glyphosate resistance was widespread in common waterhemp (81\% of the screened populations), few Palmer amaranth populations were glyphosate-resistant (6\% of the screened populations), whereas no glyphosate-resistant redroot pigweed populations were identified in Nebraska. Weed species, geographic region within the state, and current crop were the most important factors predicting the occurrence of glyphosate resistance in fields infested with Amaranthus species in Nebraska. CONCLUSION The intensive glyphosate selection pressure exerted in soybean (Glycine max) fields in eastern Nebraska is one of the major factors causing widespread occurrence of glyphosate resistance in common waterhemp in the state. The relatively low frequency of glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth in the state highlights the importance of the application timing and the adoption of multiple modes of action in weed management practices to delay the evolution of glyphosate resistance. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

The objective of this study was to identify environmental and agronomic factors contributing to the incidence of the disease across the Corn Belt through a multistate survey conducted during the 2011 growing season. Of the 2,400 surveys distributed throughout nine states, 486 were returned with corn leaf samples, of which 70\% tested positive for C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The agronomic data associated with each field were analyzed using classification and regression tree and random forest analyses to identify the factors that contributed most to Goss’s bacterial wilt and leaf blight development. A χ2 test of independence was also done to determine relationships between certain variables and disease incidence. The two best predictors of Goss’s bacterial wilt and leaf blight were hybrid resistance to Goss’s bacterial wilt and leaf blight, as indicated by the seed companies’ score and a planting population density {$>$}67,500 plants ha−1. Other important predictors included longitude, planting date, crop rotation, percent residue, yield history, tillage, and growth stage. Relationships between glyphosate applications, foliar fungicide applications, and corn rootworm beetle with samples testing positive for C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis were also detected. These data contribute to our understanding of factors that increase the risk of Goss’s bacterial wilt and leaf blight, and should enable more effective management practices to be adopted or developed.},

In this study, we examined segregation patterns of EPSPS gene-copy numbers in F1 and F2 generations of A. palmeri and found no evidence of a Mendelian single-gene pattern of inheritance. Transgressive segregation for copy number was exhibited by several F1 and all of the F2 families, most likely the product of EPSPS copy-number variation within each plant. This variation was confirmed by assaying gene-copy number across clonal generations and among individual shoots on the same plant, demonstrating that EPSPS amplification levels vary significantly within a single plant. Increases and decreases in copy number occurred in a controlled, stress-free environment in the absence of glyphosate, indicating that EPSPS gene amplification is a random and variable process within the plant. The ability of A. palmeri to gain or lose EPSPS gene copies is a valuable adaptive trait, allowing this species to respond rapidly to selection pressures and changing environments.},

  abstract = {Following the introduction of glyphosate-resistant (GR)-cotton crops in Mexico, farmers have relied upon glyphosate as being the only herbicide for in-season weed control. Continuous use of glyphosate within the same year and over multiple successive years has resulted in the selection of glyphosate resistance in Palmer amaranth (Amarantus palmeri). Dose-response assays confirmed resistance in seven different accessions. The resistance ratio based on GR50 values (50\% growth reduction) varied between 12 and 83. At 1000~μM glyphosate, shikimic acid accumulation in the S-accession was 30- to 2-fold higher at compared to R-accessions. At 96~h after treatment, 35–44\% and 61\% of applied 14C-glyphosate was taken up by leaves of plants from R- and S-accessions, respectively. At this time, a significantly higher proportion of the glyphosate absorbed remained in the treated leaf of R-plants (55–69\%) compared to S-plants (36\%). Glyphosate metabolism was low and did not differ between resistant and susceptible plants. Glyphosate was differentially metabolized to AMPA and glyoxylate in plants of R- and S-accessions, although it was low in both accessions ({$<$}10\%). There were differences in 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) enzyme activity by 50\% (I50) between R- and S-accessions. However, no significant differences were found in the basal EPSPS activity (μmol inorganic phosphate μg−1 total soluble protein min−1) between R- and S-accessions. A point mutation Pro-106-Ser was evidenced in three accessions. The results confirmed the resistance of Palmer amaranth accessions to glyphosate collected from GR-cotton crops from Mexico. This is the first study demonstrating glyphosate-resistance in Palmer amaranth from Mexico.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding and managing the evolutionary responses of pests and pathogens to control efforts is essential to human health and survival. Herbicide-resistant (HR) weeds undermine agricultural sustainability, productivity and profitability, yet the epidemiology of resistance evolution – particularly at landscape scales – is poorly understood. We studied glyphosate resistance in a major agricultural weed, Amaranthus tuberculatus (common waterhemp), using landscape, weed and management data from 105 central Illinois grain farms, including over 500 site-years of herbicide application records.
RESULTS: Glyphosate-resistant (GR) A. tuberculatus occurrence was greatest in fields with frequent glyphosate applications, high annual rates of herbicide mechanism of action (MOA) turnover and few MOAs field−1 year−1. Combining herbicide MOAs at the time of application by herbicide mixing reduced the likelihood of GR A. tuberculatus.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate the importance of examining large-scale evolutionary processes at relevant spatial scales. Although measures such as herbicide mixing may delay GR or other HR weed traits, they are unlikely to prevent them. Long-term weed management will require truly diversified management practices that minimize selection for herbicide resistance traits.},

  abstract = {Herbicide rotations and mixtures are widely recommended to manage herbicide resistance. However, little research has quantified how these practices actually affect the selection of herbicide resistance in weeds. A 4-yr experiment was conducted in western Canada from 2004 to 2007 to examine the impact of herbicide rotation and mixture in selecting for acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitor resistance in the annual broadleaf weed, field pennycress, co-occurring in wheat. Treatments consisted of the ALS-inhibitor herbicide, ethametsulfuron, applied in a mixture with bromoxynil/MCPA formulated herbicide (photosystem-II inhibitor/synthetic auxin), or in rotation with the non-ALS inhibitor at an ALS-inhibitor application frequency of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100\% (i.e., zero to four applications, respectively) over the 4-yr period. The field pennycress seed bank at the start of the experiment contained 5\% ethametsulfuron-resistant seed. Although weed control was only marginally reduced, resistance frequency of progeny of survivors increased markedly after one ALS-inhibitor application. At the end of the experiment, the level of resistance in the seed bank was buffered by susceptible seed, increasing from 29\% of recruited seedlings after one application to 85\% after four applications of the ALS inhibitor. The level of resistance in the seed bank for the mixture treatment after 4 yr remained similar to that of the nontreated (weedy) control or 0\% ALS-inhibitor rotation frequency treatment. The results of this study demonstrate how rapidly ALS-inhibitor resistance can evolve as a consequence of repeated application of herbicides with this site of action, and supports epidemiological information from farmer questionnaire surveys and modeling simulations that mixtures are more effective than rotations in mitigating resistance evolution through herbicide selection.},

We studied weed shifts in cropping sequences differing in the identity and number of crops grown. We also evaluated whether dissimilar weed communities in different cropping systems converge towards more similar communities, when the same sequence is cropped during 2 years. In three locations in the Rolling Pampa, Argentina, field experiments were conducted including five cropping systems in the first year (winter cereal/soyabean, field pea/soyabean, and field pea/maize double crops, and maize and soyabean as single crops), while the same sequence was grown in the following 2 years (wheat/soyabean double crop and maize). Changes in weed community composition and structure were analysed through multivariate analyses and frequency–species ranking plots. Weed communities differed first among sites, while weed shifts within each site were mainly associated with growing season and crop type. Differences among crop sequences were higher in the first year, mostly related to specific crop grown, rather than to the number of crops in the sequences. Differences were reduced when the same sequence was grown during two consecutive seasons. Frequency of highly common weeds was negatively associated with the number of days with high crop cover. Our findings contribute to understand weed shifts in consecutive growing seasons, which may help readapting crop sequences to reduce the occurrence of abundant weed species.},

GE crops have been blamed for increased problems with herbicide-resistant weeds (colloquially called by the misnomer “superweeds”); however, there has been no rigorous analysis of herbicide use or herbicide-resistant weed evolution to quantify the impact of GE crops on herbicide resistance. Here, I analyze data from the International Survey of Herbicide Resistant Weeds and the USDA and demonstrate that adoption of GE corn varieties did not reduce herbicide diversity, and therefore likely did not increase selection pressure for herbicide-resistant weeds in that crop. Adoption of GE herbicide-resistant varieties substantially reduced herbicide diversity in cotton and soybean. Increased glyphosate use in cotton and soybean largely displaced herbicides that are more likely to select for herbicide-resistant weeds, which at least partially mitigated the impact of reduced herbicide diversity. The overall rate of newly confirmed herbicide-resistant weed species to all herbicide sites of action (SOAs) has slowed in the United States since 2005. Although the number of glyphosate-resistant weeds has increased since 1998, the evolution of new glyphosate-resistant weed species as a function of area sprayed has remained relatively low compared with several other commonly used herbicide SOAs.},

  abstract = {Herbicides with new modes of action are badly needed to manage the evolution of resistance of weeds to existing herbicides. Yet no major new mode of action has been introduced to the market place for about 20 years. There are probably several reasons for this. New potential products may have remained dormant owing to concerns that glyphosate-resistant (GR) crops have reduced the market for a new herbicide. The capture of a large fraction of the herbicide market by glyphosate with GR crops led to significantly diminished herbicide discovery efforts. Some of the reduced herbicide discovery research was also due to company consolidations and the availability of more generic herbicides. Another problem might be that the best herbicide molecular target sites may have already been discovered. However, target sites that are not utilized, for which there are inhibitors that are highly effective at killing plants, suggests that this is not true. Results of modern methods of target site discovery (e.g. gene knockout methods) are mostly not public, but there is no evidence of good herbicides with new target sites coming from these approaches. In summary, there are several reasons for a long dry period for new herbicide target sites; however, the relative magnitude of each is unclear. The economic stimulus to the herbicide industry caused by the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds, especially GR weeds, may result in one or more new modes of action becoming available in the not too distant future.

  abstract = {Glyphosate is the only herbicide to target the enzyme 5-enolpyruvyl-3-shikimate phosphate synthase (EPSPS). It is a high use rate, non-selective herbicide that translocates primarily to metabolic sinks, killing meristematic tissues away from the application site. Its phloem-mobile properties and slow action in killing weeds allow the herbicide to move throughout the plant to kill all meristems, making it effective for perennial weed control. Since commercialization in 1974, its use has grown to dominate the herbicide market. Much of its use is on transgenic, glyphosate-resistant crops (GRCs), which have been the dominant transgenic crops worldwide. GRCs with glyphosate provided the most effective and inexpensive weed management technology in history for a decade or more. However, as a consequence of the rapid increase in glyphosate-resistant (GR) weeds, the effectiveness of glyphosate use in GRCs is declining. Critics have claimed that glyphosate-treated GRCs have altered mineral nutrition and increased susceptibility to plant pathogens because of glyphosate's ability to chelate divalent metal cations, but the complete resistance of GRCs to glyphosate indicates that chelating metal cations do not contribute to the herbicidal activity or significantly affect mineral nutrition. The rates of increases in yields of maize, soybean, and cotton in the USA have been unchanged after high adoption rates of GRCs. Glyphosate is toxic to some plant pathogens, and thereby can act as a fungicide in GRCs. Ultra-low doses of glyphosate stimulate plant growth in glyphosate-susceptible plants by unknown mechanisms. Despite rapid and widespread increases in GR weeds, glyphosate use has not decreased. However, as GR weeds increase, adoption of alternative technologies will eventually lead to decreased use.

  abstract = {Main conclusion Field-evolved resistance to the herbicide glyphosate is due to amplification of one of two EPSPS alleles, increasing transcription and protein with no splice variants or effects on other pathway genes. The widely used herbicide glyphosate inhibits the shikimate pathway enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). Globally, the intensive use of glyphosate for weed control has selected for glyphosate resistance in 31 weed species. Populations of suspected glyphosate-resistant Kochia scoparia were collected from fields located in the US central Great Plains. Glyphosate dose response verified glyphosate resistance in nine populations. The mechanism of resistance to glyphosate was investigated using targeted sequencing, quantitative PCR, immunoblotting, and whole transcriptome de novo sequencing to characterize the sequence and expression of EPSPS. Sequence analysis showed no mutation of the EPSPS Pro106 codon in glyphosate-resistant K. scoparia, whereas EPSPS genomic copy number and transcript abundance were elevated three- to ten-fold in resistant individuals relative to susceptible individuals. Glyphosate-resistant individuals with increased relative EPSPS copy numbers had consistently lower shikimate accumulation in leaf disks treated with 100 μM glyphosate and EPSPS protein levels were higher in glyphosate-resistant individuals with increased gene copy number compared to glyphosate-susceptible individuals. RNA sequence analysis revealed seven nucleotide positions with two different expressed alleles in glyphosate-susceptible reads. However, one nucleotide at the seven positions was predominant in glyphosate-resistant sequences, suggesting that only one of two EPSPS alleles was amplified in glyphosate-resistant individuals. No alternatively spliced EPSPS transcripts were detected. Expression of five other genes in the chorismate pathway was unaffected in glyphosate-resistant individuals with increased EPSPS expression. These results indicate increased EPSPS expression is a mechanism for glyphosate resistance in these K. scoparia populations.},

Genetic mechanisms by which weeds evolve resistance to herbicides largely determine the level of resistance and the rate of evolution of resistance. In a previous study, we determined that glyphosate resistance in Kochia scoparia is due to the amplification of the 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase (EPSPS) gene, the enzyme target of glyphosate. Here, we investigated the genomic organization of the amplified EPSPS copies using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and extended DNA fiber (Fiber FISH) on K. scoparia chromosomes. In both glyphosate-resistant K. scoparia populations tested (GR1 and GR2), FISH results displayed a single and prominent hybridization site of the EPSPS gene localized on the distal end of one pair of homologous metaphase chromosomes compared with a faint hybridization site in glyphosate-susceptible samples (GS1 and GS2). Fiber FISH displayed 10 copies of the EPSPS gene (approximately 5 kb) arranged in tandem configuration approximately 40 to 70 kb apart, with one copy in an inverted orientation in GR2. In agreement with FISH results, segregation of EPSPS copies followed single-locus inheritance in GR1 population. This is the first report of tandem target gene amplification conferring field-evolved herbicide resistance in weed populations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the world and has been intensively used to control B. diandrus, a problematic weed of crops and pastures in southern Australia. RESULTS Resistance to glyphosate was identified in two populations of B. diandrus that were nearly fivefold more resistant to glyphosate than wild-type plants. Both populations contained EPSPS gene amplification, with resistant plants having an average of around 20-fold the number of copies of EPSPS compared with susceptible plants. EPSPS expression was also increased in resistant plants of both populations; however, expression levels were not correlated with the number of EPSPS copies. Amplification of only one of the four EPSPS genes present in B. diandus was detected. Investigation into the inheritance of glyphosate resistance found no segregation in the F2 generation. Every individual in the F2 populations contained between three and 30 copies of EPSPS; however, on average they contained fewer copies compared with the parent resistant population. CONCLUSIONS Glyphosate resistance in B. diandrus is due to EPSPS gene amplification. Resistance is heritable but complex. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry},

GR kochia accessions with 4.6- to 11-fold levels of resistance to glyphosate have recently been reported in Montana. Those GR kochia accessions were also suspected to be resistant to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors, i.e., multiple herbicide-resistant (MHR) kochia. In this research, the level of resistance to the ALS-inhibitor herbicides (sulfonylureas) and the molecular mechanisms conferring resistance to glyphosate and ALS-inhibitor herbicides in MHR kochia was investigated. On the basis of whole-plant dose–response assays, MHR kochia accessions (GIL01, JOP01, and CHES01) were 9.3- to 30-fold more resistant to premixed thifensulfuron methyl + tribenuron methyl + metsulfuron methyl than the susceptible (SUS) accession. In an in vivo leaf-disk shikimate assay, MHR plants accumulated less shikimate than the SUS plants at a discriminate dose of 100 mM glyphosate. Sequencing of the conserved region of EPSPS revealed no target-site mutation at Thr102 or Pro106 residue. MHR kochia accessions had increased relative EPSPS gene copies (, 4 to 10) compared with the SUS accession (single copy). Furthermore, MHR kochia accumulated higher EPSPS protein compared with the SUS plants. Resistance to the ALS-inhibitor herbicides was conferred by Pro197 amino acid substitution (proline to glutamine). EPSPS gene amplification and a single target-site mutation at Pro197 in ALS gene confer resistance to glyphosate and ALS-inhibitor herbicides, respectively, in MHR kochia accessions from Montana. This is the first confirmation of occurrence of MHR kochia in Montana. Nomenclature: Glyphosate; metsulfuron methyl; thifensulfuron methyl; tribenuron methyl; Kochia, Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad.},

Sauer] population from Missouri (designated MO-Ren). In the field, visual control of the MO-Ren population with 0.56 to 4.48 kg 2,4-D ha−1 ranged from 26\% to 77\% in 2015 and from 15\% to 55\% in 2016. The MO-Ren population was highly resistant to chlorimuron, with visual control never exceeding 7\% either year. Estimates of the 2,4-D dose required to provide 50\% visual control (I50) of the MO-Ren population were 1.44 kg ha−1 compared with only 0.47 kg 2,4-D ha−1 for the susceptible population. Based on comparisons to a susceptible population in dose–response experiments, the MO-Ren population was approximately 3-fold resistant to 2,4-D, and 7-, 7-, 22-, and 14-fold resistant to atrazine, fomesafen, glyphosate, and mesotrione, respectively. Dicamba and glufosinate were the only two herbicides that provided effective control of the MO-Ren population in these experiments. Examinations of multiple herbicide resistance at the individual plant level revealed that 16\% of the plants of the MO-Ren population contained genes stacked for six-way herbicide resistance, and only 1\% of plants were classified as resistant to a single herbicide (glyphosate). Results from these experiments confirm that the MO-Ren A. tuberculatus population is resistant to 2,4-D, atrazine, chlorimuron, fomesafen, glyphosate, and mesotrione, making this population the third 2,4-D–resistant A. tuberculatus population identified in the United States, and the first population resistant to six different herbicidal modes of action.},

One route that leads to enhanced metabolism is the duplication or amplification of the structural gene(s) encoding the detoxifying enzyme, and this has now been described for the three main families (esterases, glutathione S-transferases and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases) implicated in resistance. More recently, a direct or indirect role for gene duplication or amplification has been described for target-site resistance in several arthropod species.

  abstract = {The Resistance to Dieldrin gene, Rdl, encodes a GABA-gated chloride channel subunit that is targeted by cyclodiene and phenylpyrazole insecticides. The gene was first characterized in Drosophila melanogaster by genetic mapping of resistance to the cyclodiene dieldrin. The 4,000-fold resistance observed was due to a single amino acid replacement, Ala301 to Ser. The equivalent change was subsequently identified in Rdl orthologs of a large range of resistant insect species. Here, we report identification of a duplication at the Rdl locus in D. melanogaster. The 113-kb duplication contains one WT copy of Rdl and a second copy with two point mutations: an Ala301 to Ser resistance mutation and Met360 to Ile replacement. Individuals with this duplication exhibit intermediate dieldrin resistance compared with single copy Ser301 homozygotes, reduced temperature sensitivity, and altered RNA editing associated with the resistant allele. Ectopic recombination between Roo transposable elements is involved in generating this genomic rearrangement. The duplication phenotypes were confirmed by construction of a transgenic, artificial duplication integrating the 55.7-kb Rdl locus with a Ser301 change into an Ala301 background. Gene duplications can contribute significantly to the evolution of insecticide resistance, most commonly by increasing the amount of gene product produced. Here however, duplication of the Rdl target site creates permanent heterozygosity, providing unique potential for adaptive mutations to accrue in one copy, without abolishing the endogenous role of an essential gene.},

Sauer] population (CHR) resistant to 2,4-D and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)-, photosystem II–, acetolactate synthase (ALS)-, and protoporphyrinogen oxidase–inhibiting herbicides. Two field experiments were designed to investigate the efficacy of very-long-chain fatty-acid (VLCFA)-inhibiting herbicides, including a comparison of active ingredients at labeled use rates and a rate titration experiment. Amaranthus tuberculatus density and control were evaluated at 28 and 42 d after treatment (DAT). Nonencapsulated acetochlor, alachlor, and pyroxasulfone provided the greatest PRE control of CHR (56\% to 75\%) at 28 DAT, while metolachlor, S-metolachlor, dimethenamid-P, and encapsulated acetochlor provided less than 27\% control. In the rate titration study, nonencapsulated acetochlor controlled CHR more than equivalent field use rates of S-metolachlor. Subsequent dose–response experiments with acetochlor, S-metolachlor, dimethenamid-P, and pyroxasulfone in the greenhouse included three multiple herbicide–resistant (MHR) A. tuberculatus populations: CHR-M6 (progeny generated from CHR), MCR-NH40 (progeny generated from Mclean County, IL), and ACR (Adams County, IL), in comparison with a sensitive population (WUS). Both CHR-M6 and MCR-NH40 are MHR to atrazine and HPPD, and ALS inhibitors and demonstrated higher survival rates (LD50) to S-metolachlor, acetochlor, dimethenamid-P, or pyroxasulfone than ACR (atrazine resistant but HPPD-inhibitor sensitive) and WUS. Based on biomass reduction (GR50), resistant to sensitive (R:S) ratios between CHR-M6 and WUS were 7.5, 6.1, 5.5, and 2.9 for S-metolachlor, acetochlor, dimethenamid-P, and pyroxasulfone, respectively. Values were greater for MCR-NH40 than CHR-M6, and ACR was the most sensitive to all VLCFA inhibitors tested. Complete control of all populations was achieved at or below a field use rate of acetochlor. In summary, field studies demonstrated CHR is not controlled by several VLCFA-inhibiting herbicides. Greenhouse dose–response experiments corroborated field results and generated R:S ratios (LD50) ranging from 4.5 to 64 for CHR-M6 and MCR-NH40 among the four VLCFA-inhibiting herbicides evaluated.},

Research was conducted to investigate anecdotal observations suggesting that target site–based resistances to inhibitors of acetolactate synthase (ALS) and protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) did not follow independent assortment in common waterhemp. Cosegregation of the two resistances was observed in backcross lines (population sensitive to both herbicides as recurrent parent). Specifically, whereas 52\% of backcross plants were resistant to a PPO inhibitor, this percentage increased to 92\% when the backcross plants were preselected for resistance to an ALS inhibitor. Molecular marker analysis confirmed that the corresponding genes (ALS and PPX2) were genetically linked. When data from all plants analyzed were pooled, the genetic distance between the two genes was calculated to be 7.5 cM. The two genes were found to be about 195 kb apart in the recently published grain amaranth genome, explaining the observed genetic linkage. There is likely enough recombination that occurs between the linked genes to prevent the linkage from having significant implications in terms of resistance evolution. Nevertheless, documentation of the happenstance linkage between target-site genes for resistance to ALS and PPO inhibitors in waterhemp is a reminder that one should not assume distinct resistance mechanism will independently assort.},

However, a metabolism-based, HPPD-inhibitor resistant waterhemp population from Illinois (named SIR) was suspected of having a non-target site resistance (NTSR) mechanism due to its resistance to carfentrazone-ethyl (CE) but sensitivity to diphenylethers (DPEs). In greenhouse experiments, SIR sustained less injury than two PPO inhibitor-sensitive populations (WCS and SEN) after applying a field-use rate of CE, and after initial rapid necrosis, regrowth of SIR plants was comparable to a known PPO inhibitor-resistant population (ACR) possessing the ΔG210 mutation. Dose-response analysis determined 50\% growth reduction rates in CE-resistant (SIR and ACR) and sensitive (SEN) waterhemp populations, which showed SIR was 30-fold resistant compared to SEN and two-fold more resistant than ACR. Deduced amino acid sequences derived from SIR PPX2 partial cDNAs did not contain the ΔG210 mutation found in ACR or other target-site mutations that confer PPO-inhibitor resistance previously reported in Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri). Although several SIR cDNAs contained amino acid substitutions, none were uniform among samples. Additionally, SIR plants treated with malathion and CE showed a significant reduction in biomass accumulation compared to CE alone. These results indicate robust CE resistance in SIR is not mediated by amino acid changes in the PPO2 protein, but instead resistance may be conferred through a NTSR mechanism such as enhanced herbicide metabolism.},

  abstract = {Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson), a dioecious summer annual species, is one of the most troublesome weeds in U.S. cropping systems. The evolution of resistance to protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitors in A. palmeri biotypes is a major cause of concern to soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) growers in the midsouthern United States. The objective of this study was to confirm and characterize the non–target site mechanism in a fomesafen-resistant accession from Randolph County, AR (RCA). A dose–response assay was conducted to assess the level of fomesafen resistance, and based on the GR50 values, the RCA accession was 18-fold more resistant to fomesafen than a susceptible (S) biotype. A TaqMan allelic discrimination assay and sequencing of the target-site genes PPX2 and PPX1 revealed no known or novel target-site mutations. An SYBR Green assay indicated no difference in PPX2 gene expression between the RCA and S biotypes. To test whether fomesafen resistance is metabolic in nature, the RCA and the S biotypes were treated with different cytochrome P450 (amitrole, piperonyl butoxide [PBO], malathion) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) (4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan [NBD-Cl]) inhibitors, either alone or in combination with fomesafen. Malathion followed by (fb) fomesafen in RCA showed the greatest reduction in survival (67\%) and biomass (86\%) compared with fomesafen alone (45\% and 66\%, respectively) at 2 wk after treatment. Interestingly, NBD-Cl fb fomesafen also resulted in low survival (35\%) compared with the fomesafen-only treatment (55\%). Applications of malathion or NBD-Cl preceding fomesafen treatment resulted in reversal of fomesafen resistance, indicating the existence of cytochrome P450– and GST-based non–target site mechanisms in the RCA accession. This study confirms the first case of non–target site resistance to fomesafen in A. palmeri.},

  abstract = {Protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO)-inhibiting herbicides are used to control weeds in a variety of crops. These herbicides inhibit heme and photosynthesis in plants. PPO-inhibiting herbicides are used to control Amaranthus palmeri (Palmer amaranth) especially those with resistance to glyphosate and acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibiting herbicides. While investigating the basis of high fomesafen-resistance in A. palmeri, we identified a new amino acid substitution of glycine to alanine in the catalytic domain of PPO2 at position 399 (G399A) (numbered according to the protein sequence of A. palmeri). G399 is highly conserved in the PPO protein family across eukaryotic species. Through combined molecular, computational, and biochemical approaches, we established that PPO2 with G399A mutation has reduced affinity for several PPO-inhibiting herbicides, possibly due to steric hindrance induced by the mutation. This is the first report of a PPO2 amino acid substitution at this G399 position in a field-selected weed population of A. palmeri. The mutant A. palmeri PPO2 showed high-level in vitro resistance to different PPO inhibitors relative to the wild type. The G399A mutation is very likely to confer resistance to other weed species under selection imposed by the extensive agricultural use of PPO-inhibiting herbicides.},

  abstract = {In a previous study, glyphosate-susceptible and -resistant giant ragweed
biotypes grown in sterile field soil survived a higher rate of glyphosate
than those grown in unsterile field soil, and the roots of the susceptible
biotype were colonized by a larger number of soil microorganisms than those
of the resistant biotype when treated with 1.6 kg ae ha−1
glyphosate. Thus, we concluded that soil-borne microbes play a role in
glyphosate activity and now hypothesize that the ability of the resistant
biotype to tolerate glyphosate may involve microbial interactions in the
rhizosphere. The objective of this study was to evaluate differences in the
rhizosphere microbial communities of glyphosate-susceptible and -resistant
giant ragweed biotypes 3 d after a glyphosate treatment. Giant ragweed
biotypes were grown in the greenhouse in unsterile field soil and glyphosate
was applied at either 0 or 1.6 kg ha−1. Rhizosphere soil was
sampled 3 d after the glyphosate treatment, and DNA was extracted, purified,
and sequenced with the use of Illumina Genome Analyzer next-generation
sequencing. The taxonomic distribution of the microbial community,
diversity, genera abundance, and community structure within the rhizosphere
of the two giant ragweed biotypes in response to a glyphosate application
was evaluated by metagenomics analysis. Bacteria comprised approximately 96\%
of the total microbial community in both biotypes, and differences in the
distribution of some microbes at the phyla level were observed. Select
soil-borne plant pathogens (Verticillium and
Xanthomonas) and plant-growth–promoting rhizobacteria
(Burkholderia) present in the rhizosphere were
influenced by either biotype or glyphosate application. We did not, however,
observe large differences in the diversity or structure of soil microbial
communities among our treatments. The results of this study indicate that
challenging giant ragweed biotypes with glyphosate causes perturbations in
rhizosphere microbial communities and that the perturbations differ between
the susceptible and resistant biotypes. However, biological relevance of the
rhizosphere microbial community data that we obtained by next-generation
sequencing remains unclear.},
